# Solar Powered Line-Following Robot Car
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Second Milestone
For my Second Milestone, my robot car can now follow a black line. The robot car has a button to turn it on and off, and it uses the information of two IR sensors to determine which direction to turn in order to follow a black line. Depending on whether each IR sensor detects black or white, I coded an L298N motor driver to change the speed and direction of the spinning wheels.
My next step will be working with solar panels to modify my line-following robot car and make it powered by the sun.

# First Milestone
For my First Milestone, I have set up two IR sensors to detect a black line. Each sensor can now differentiate between black and white, and based off of the outputs of two sensors side-by-side, I have created code that can determine whether the robot car should turn left, turn right, or continue moving straight.
My next step will be assembling the chassis of my robot car, and using the outputs of the IR sensors to control the robot car and allow it to follow a black line.
