# Solar Powered Line-Following Robot Car
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

For my First Milestone, I have set up two IR sensors to detect a black line. Each sensor can now differentiate between black and white, and based off of the outputs of two sensors side-by-side, I have created code that can determine whether the robot car should turn left, turn right, or continue moving straight.
My next step will be assembling the chassis of my robot car, and using the outputs of the IR sensors to control the robot car and allow it to follow a black line.
